            <h4>Neha Sharma</h4>
            <p>I have faced ragging. It was a kind of weird experience for me.

                Actually, I joined an NGO there which used to provide free education to the children of villages that
                were near Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India and Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh, India.

            <p>The momentous event of my ragging took place during the first year of college. Till date, it remains
                firmly etched in my memory. Probably, because there isn’t really a parallel to this sort of an
                experience. So, here goes the story of my ragging experience.</p>

    <div class="laws">
        <h1>Laws and Regulations </h1>
        <div class="aboutp">While ragging is not a specific offence, it could be penalised under several other
            provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
            For example, the offence of wrongful restraint is criminalised under Section 339 of the IPC which is
            punished with simple imprisonment up to 1 month, or with fine up to Rs 500, or with both. <br>
            Wrongful restraint is an offence when a person is prevented from proceeding in any direction in which that
            person has a right to proceed. <br>
            Section 340 criminalises wrongful confinement which is defined as wrongfully restraining any person in such
            a manner as to prevent that person from proceedings beyond certain circumscribing limits.
